<h1>Inside Actors: Humana Festival</h1>


The Humana Festival of New American Plays is an internationally renowned festival that celebrates the contemporary American playwright. Produced annually by Actors Theatre of Louisville, this festival showcases new theatrical works and draws producers, critics, playwrights, and theatre lovers from around the world.

For The 2011 Humana Festival we created a special edition of the Inside Actors magazine designed for print and developed as an interactive iPad app.

the poster illustrated by Josh Cochran was the centerpiece of the marketing campaign surrounding the festival. To compliment the Josh's poster and illustrations I created unique posters for each of the individual plays that comprised the festival.

This special interactive issue of Inside Actors was featured in the 2011 Louisville Graphic Design Association 100 Show.
