<p>For The 2011 Humana Festival we created a special edition of the Inside Actors magazine designed for print and developed as an interactive iPad app.</p>

<p>the poster illustrated by Josh Cochran was the centerpiece of the marketing campaign surrounding the festival. To compliment the Josh's poster and illustrations I created unique posters for each of the individual plays that comprised the festival.</p>

<p>This special interactive issue of Inside Actors was featured in the 2011 Louisville Graphic Design Association 100 Show.</p>
