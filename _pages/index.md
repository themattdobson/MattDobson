<h1 id="hellothereimmattdobsonaproductdesignerlivinginlouisvilleky"> I’m  a product designer at <a class="underline" href="http://www.humana.com/">Humana</a>.</h1>

<p>I’m fortunate to be part of the team at Humana’s <a class="underline" href="http://www.humana.io/">Digital Experience Center</a> a technology incubator working to transform Humana into a human-centered, tech-driven company. In my free time I help organize the Louisville’s <a class="underline" href="https://www.meetup.com/ixdalouisville/">IxDA chapter</a> and in 2016 was part of the team that organized the <a class="underline" href="http://2016.midwestuxconference.com/">Midwest UX Conference</a> in Louisville.</p>

<p>Previously I was an art director at <a class="underline" href="https://www.poweragency.com/">Power</a>, published a <a class="underline" href="http://www.thelouisvillepaper.com/">monthly newspaper</a>, and was a co-producer of a late-night variety show at a <a class="underline" href="https://actorstheatre.org/">Tony Award winning theatre</a>.</p>
